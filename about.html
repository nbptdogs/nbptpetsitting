                    <h2>Our Story</h2>
                    <p>Founded in 2020, Sunset Paws grew from a lifelong love of animals and the beautiful coastal community of Newburyport. As a local who grew up near the beach, I've always found joy in the company of dogs, especially my beloved English Cream Retrievers.</p>
                    <p>My passion for pet care and the serene beach environment inspired me to create a pet sitting service that offers more than just basic care. At Sunset Paws, we provide a unique experience that combines professional pet sitting with the relaxing atmosphere of coastal living.</p>
